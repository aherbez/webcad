# Web-based CAD starter project

This is a simple bit of boilerplate for making any number of special-purpose, web-based CAD tools.

It uses ThreeJS to render 3d geometry, and to provide an STL download.

Out of the box, you'll get options for specifying the width, depth, and height of a rectangular prism.
To make something more interesting, put some custom code in the `makeGeo` function in `makeGeo.js`.

If you'd like to see a video explanation of the code, please check out [the talk I gave at the 2020 Rogulike Celebration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMQuoI_M-kk)

Here are a couple examples of the kinds of things you can make with this approach:

- [A "greeblie" modeler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBzUj6L5PA)
- [A tool for making sinusoidal grooves for cylindrical cams](https://www.adrianherbez.net/2021/10/web-based-cad-for-cams/)

Enjoy! And if you make something using this, please do let me know- I'd love to see it!
